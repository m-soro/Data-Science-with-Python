# Post your work on Github

In this part of the nanodegree program, I'll use github to simulate a development workflow. 

* fork a repo
* set up a remote repo 
* create branch(es) 
* stage commits
* push commits
* fetch updates
* merge branch(es)
* handle any merge conflict that may arise
* delete unwanted branch(es)
* edit past commits using rebase

I made a couple of edits (mainly comment updates)in my bikeshare project. I also made a couple of edits in the attached readme file, then filled the neccessary information regarding the git commands in the submission template.
