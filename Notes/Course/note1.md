# Helpful tips:

In `Joins SQL Queries.txt` 
* Quiz 6: Pre-filter on the `ON` clause using `AND`
* Quiz 13: Notice that the endpoint is '2016-01-01' the later part of the `BETWEEN` clause is ommitted.

* `NULL` is not a value but a property of the data, therefore `NULL = 0` does not work! When working with `NULL`s you write `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL`.
