# How I started this website

Hello, this website is using just-the-docs remote-theme from Jekyll.
See my `_config.yml` file. At First I was developing this locally, but I ran into issues.
`<insert issue here>`. So I decided to use a remote-theme.
  
This will be just personal notes to myself in case I need to re-create this again.

- I started this as a regular github pages(cayman theme) I think, then change it to remote-theme. Maybe do the same for next project?

- Since I started developing locally using jekyll. I just uploaded the directories, sub directories and files that I need.

- `README.md` and `index.md` are both completely different file. `README.md` is the actual readme file, while `index.md` is what is actually rendered. In `index.md` I can set the front matter `title`, `nav_order`, `image`, etc. it depends on the theme(I'm unsure)?. This was my issue with the last project website. I did not have an `index.md`

- Next time, use the defaults in `_config.yml`

- Before starting a project website, make sure I know what directories and pages are going to be required.
