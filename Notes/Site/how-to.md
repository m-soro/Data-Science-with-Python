# How I started this website

Hello, this website is using just-the-docs remote-theme from Jekyll.
See my `_config.yml` file. At First I was developing this locally, but I ran into issues.
<insert issue here>. So I decided to use a remote-theme.
  
This will be just personal notes to mysel in case I need to re-create this again:

- `README.md` and `index.md` are both completely different file. `README.md` is actual readme file, while `index.md` is what is actually rendered.
In `index.md` I can set the front matter `title`, `nav_order`, `image`, etc. it depends on the theme(I'm unsure)?

- Before starting a project website, make sure I know what directories and pages are going to be required.
