In the following concepts you will be learning in detail about each of the aggregate functions mentioned as well as some additional aggregate functions that are used in SQL all the time. Let's get started!

### [Introduction to NULLs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYUkLKn6XCw)
<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WYUkLKn6XCw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>   

**NULLs** are a datatype that specifies where no data exists in SQL. They are often ignored in our aggregation functions, which you will get a first look at in the next concept using **COUNT**.

### [NULLs and Aggregation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgTcYwKqtYI)
<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RgTcYwKqtYI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>   

Notice that **NULLs** are different than a zero - they are cells where data does not exist.

When identifying NULLs in a WHERE clause, we write **IS NULL** or **IS NOT NULL**. We don't use =, because **NULL isn't considered a value in SQL**. Rather, it is a property of the data.

**NULLs - Expert Tip**

There are two common ways in which you are likely to encounter NULLs:

1. **NULLs** frequently occur when performing a **LEFT or RIGHT JOIN**. You saw in the last lesson - when some rows in the left table of a left join are not matched with rows in the right table, those rows will contain some NULL values in the result set.

2. **NULLs** can also occur from simply missing data in our database.

### [COUNT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4FCWAEGmLg)
<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b4FCWAEGmLg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>  

COUNT the Number of Rows in a Table
Try your hand at finding the number of rows in each table. Here is an example of finding all the rows in the accounts table.
```
  SELECT COUNT(*)
  FROM accounts;
```
But we could have just as easily chosen a column to drop into the aggregation function:
```
  SELECT COUNT(accounts.id)
  FROM accounts;
```

### [COUNT & NULLs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngxgqfFFFLQ)
<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ngxgqfFFFLQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>  

Notice that COUNT does not consider rows that have NULL values. Therefore, this can be useful for quickly identifying which rows have missing data. You will learn **GROUP BY** in an upcoming concept, and then each of these aggregators will become much more useful.

### [SUM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zUP14PeiXk)
<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0zUP14PeiXk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>   

Unlike COUNT, you can only use **SUM on numeric columns**. However, SUM will ignore NULL values, as do the other aggregation functions you will see in the upcoming lessons.

**Aggregation Reminder**
An important thing to remember: **aggregators only aggregate vertically - the values of a column**. If you want to perform a calculation across rows, you would do this with simple arithmetic.

We saw this in the first lesson if you need a refresher, but the quiz in the next concept should assure you still remember how to aggregate across rows.

#### Exercises:

1. Find the total amount of poster_qty paper ordered in the orders table.
```
  SELECT SUM(poster_qty) poster_total
  FROM orders;
```
2. Find the total amount of standard_qty paper ordered in the orders table.
```
  SELECT SUM(standard_qty) standard_total
  FROM orders;
```
3. Find the total dollar amount of sales using the total_amt_usd in the orders table.
```
  SELECT SUM(total_amt_usd) total_sales
  FROM orders;
```
4. Find the total amount for each individual order that was spent on standard and gloss paper in the orders table. This should give a dollar amount for each order in the table.
```
  SELECT standard_amt_usd + gloss_amt_usd AS total_standard_gloss
  FROM orders;
```

5. Find the standard_amt_usd per unit of standard_qty paper. Your solution should use both an aggregation and a mathematical operator.
```
  SELECT	SUM(standard_amt_usd) standard_amt_total,
  		    SUM(standard_qty) standard_qty_total,
  		    SUM(standard_amt_usd)/SUM(standard_qty) per_unit
  FROM orders;
```
### [MIN & MAX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ewVsgWUih8)
<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1ewVsgWUih8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>   

Notice that here we were simultaneously obtaining the MIN and MAX number of orders of each paper type. However, you could run each individually.

Notice that **MIN** and **MAX** are aggregators that again **ignore NULL values**. Check the expert tip below for a cool trick with MAX & MIN.

**Expert Tip**

Functionally, **MIN** and **MAX** are similar to **COUNT** in that they can be **used** on **non-numerical columns**. Depending on the column type, **MIN** will return the **lowest number**, **earliest date**, or **non-numerical value as early in the alphabet as possible**. As you might suspect, **MAX** does the **opposite**—it **returns** the **highest number**, the **latest date**, or the **non-numerical value closest alphabetically to “Z.”**

### [AVG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diqCDztOL64)
<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/diqCDztOL64" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>   

Similar to other software **AVG** returns the mean of the data - that is the sum of all of the values in the column divided by the number of values in a column. This aggregate function again **ignores the NULL** values in both the numerator and the denominator.

If you want to **count NULLs as zero**, you will need to use **SUM** and **COUNT**. However, this is probably not a good idea if the NULL values truly just represent unknown values for a cell.

**MEDIAN - Expert Tip**

One quick note that a median might be a more appropriate measure of center for this data, but finding the median happens to be a pretty difficult thing to get using SQL alone — **so difficult** that finding a median is occasionally asked as an **interview question**.

#### Exercises:

1. When was the earliest order ever placed? You only need to return the date.
```
  SELECT MIN(occurred_at) earliest_order
  FROM orders;
```

2. Try performing the same query as in question 1 without using an aggregation function.
```
  SELECT occurred_at earliest_order
  FROM orders
  ORDER BY occurred_at
  LIMIT 1;
```
3. When did the most recent (latest) web_event occur?
```
  SELECT MAX(occurred_at) latest_order
  FROM orders;
```
4. Try to perform the result of the previous query without using an aggregation function.
```
  SELECT occurred_at latest_order
  FROM   orders
  ORDER BY occurred_at DESC
  LIMIT 1;
```
5. Find the mean (AVERAGE) amount spent per order on each paper type, as well as the mean amount of each paper type purchased per order. Your final answer should have 6 values - one for each paper type for the average number of sales, as well as the average amount.
```
  SELECT	AVG(standard_qty) avg_qty_standard,
  		    AVG(poster_qty) avg_qty_poster,
          AVG(gloss_qty) avg_qty_glossy,
          AVG(standard_amt_usd) avg_usd_standard,
          AVG(poster_amt_usd) avg_usd_poster,
          AVG(gloss_amt_usd) avg_usd_gloss
  FROM orders
```

6. Via the video, you might be interested in how to calculate the MEDIAN. Though this is more advanced than what we have covered so far try finding - what is the MEDIAN total_usd spent on all orders?
```
  SELECT *
  FROM (SELECT total_amt_usd
        FROM orders
        ORDER BY total_amt_usd
        LIMIT 3457) AS Table1
  ORDER BY total_amt_usd DESC
  LIMIT 2;
```
Since there are 6912 orders - we want the average of the 3457 and 3456 order amounts when ordered. This is the average of 2483.16 and 2482.55. This gives the median of 2482.855. This obviously isn't an ideal way to compute. If we obtain new orders, we would have to change the limit. SQL didn't even calculate the median for us. The above used a SUBQUERY, but you could use any method to find the two necessary values, and then you just need the average of them.

### [GROUP BY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vb67TF4WV0)
<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9vb67TF4WV0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>   


**The key takeaways here**:

**GROUP BY** can be used to **aggregate data within subsets of the data**. For example, grouping for different accounts, different regions, or different sales representatives.
**
Any column in the **SELECT** statement that **is not within an aggregator** must be in the **GROUP BY** clause.

The **GROUP BY** always goes **between WHERE** and **ORDER BY**.

ORDER BY works like SORT in spreadsheet software.

**GROUP BY - Expert Tip**

Before we dive deeper into aggregations using GROUP BY statements, it is worth noting that SQL evaluates the **aggregations before the LIMIT clause**. If you don’t group by any columns, you’ll get a 1-row result—no problem there. If you group by a column with enough unique values that it exceeds the LIMIT number, the aggregates will be calculated, and then some rows will simply be omitted from the results.

This is actually a nice way to do things because you know you’re going to get the correct aggregates. If SQL cuts the table down to 100 rows, then performed the aggregations, your results would be substantially different. The above query’s results exceed 100 rows, so it’s a perfect example. In the next concept, use the SQL environment to try removing the LIMIT and running it again to see what changes.

#### GROUP BY Note

Now that you have been introduced to JOINs, GROUP BY, and aggregate functions, the real power of SQL starts to come to life. Try some of the below to put your skills to the test!

#### Exercises: GROUP BY
Use the SQL environment below to assist with answering the following questions. Whether you get stuck or you just want to double check your solutions, my answers can be found at the top of the next concept.

One part that can be difficult to recognize is when it might be easiest to use an aggregate or one of the other SQL functionalities. Try some of the below to see if you can differentiate to find the easiest solution.

1. Which account (by name) placed the earliest order? Your solution should have the account name and the date of the order.
```
  SELECT a.name acct_name, o.occurred_at date
  FROM accounts a
  JOIN orders o
  ON a.id = o.account_id
  ORDER BY o.occurred_at
  LIMIT 1;
```
2. Find the total sales in usd for each account. You should include two columns - the total sales for each company's orders in usd and the company name.
```
  SELECT	a.name acct_name,
  		    SUM(o.total_amt_usd) grand_total
  FROM accounts a
  JOIN orders o
  ON a.id = o.account_id
  GROUP BY a.name
  ORDER BY a.name;
```

3. Via what channel did the most recent (latest) web_event occur, which account was associated with this web_event? Your query should return only three values - the date, channel, and account name.
```
  SELECT	w.occurred_at latest,
  		    w.channel channel,
          a.name acct_name
  FROM web_events w
  JOIN accounts a
  ON w.account_id = a.id
  ORDER BY w.occurred_at DESC
  LIMIT 1;
```
4. Find the total number of times each type of channel from the web_events was used. Your final table should have two columns - the channel and the number of times the channel was used.
```
  SELECT	w.channel,
  		    COUNT(w.channel)
  FROM web_events w
  GROUP BY w.channel
```

5. Who was the primary contact associated with the earliest web_event?
```
SELECT a.primary_poc contact
FROM accounts a
JOIN web_events w
ON w.account_id = a.id
ORDER BY w.occurred_at
LIMIT 1;
```

6. What was the smallest order placed by each account in terms of total usd. Provide only two columns - the account name and the total usd. Order from smallest dollar amounts to largest.
```
  SELECT	a.name acct_name,
  		    MIN(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
  FROM accounts a
  JOIN orders o
  ON a.id = o.account_id
  GROUP BY a.name
  ORDER BY total_amt;
```
7. Find the number of sales reps in each region. Your final table should have two columns - the region and the number of sales_reps. Order from fewest reps to most reps.
```
  SELECT	r.name region,
  		COUNT(s.name) sales_reps
  FROM sales_reps s
  JOIN region r
  ON s.region_id = r.id
  GROUP BY region
  ORDER BY sales_reps;
```

### [GROUP BY Part II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HQ-TshNNQA)
<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0HQ-TshNNQA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>    

**Key takeaways:**

* You can **GROUP BY** multiple columns at once, as we showed here. This is often **useful to aggregate across a number of different segments**.

* The order of columns listed in the ORDER BY clause does make a difference. You are **ordering** the columns from **left to right**.

**GROUP BY - Expert Tips**

* The order of column names in your GROUP BY clause doesn’t matter—the results will be the same regardless. If we run the same query and reverse the order in the GROUP BY clause, you can see we get the same results.

* As with **ORDER BY**, you can substitute numbers for column names in the GROUP BY clause. It’s generally recommended to do this only when you’re grouping many columns, or if something else is causing the text in the GROUP BY clause to be excessively long.

* A reminder here that any column that is not within an aggregation must show up in your GROUP BY statement. If you forget, you will likely get an error. However, in the off chance that your query does work, you might not like the results!

#### Exercises:

1. For each account, determine the average amount of each type of paper they purchased across their orders. Your result should have four columns - one for the account name and one for the average quantity purchased for each of the paper types for each account.
```
  SELECT	a.name,
  		    AVG(o.standard_qty) standard,
          AVG(o.poster_qty) poster,
          AVG(o.gloss_qty) gloss
  FROM accounts a
  JOIN orders o
  ON a.id = o.account_id
  GROUP BY a.name;
```

2. For each account, determine the average amount spent per order on each paper type. Your result should have four columns - one for the account name and one for the average amount spent on each paper type.
```
  SELECT	a.name,
  		    AVG(o.standard_amt_usd) standard_usd,
          AVG(o.gloss_amt_usd) gloss_usd,
          AVG(o.poster_amt_usd) poster_usd
  FROM accounts a
  JOIN orders o
  ON a.id = o.account_id
  GROUP BY a.name;
```

3. Determine the number of times a particular channel was used in the web_events table for each sales rep. Your final table should have three columns - the name of the sales rep, the channel, and the number of occurrences. Order your table with the highest number of occurrences first.
```
  SELECT	s.name,
  		    w.channel,
  		    COUNT(w.channel)
  FROM web_events w
  JOIN accounts a
  ON w.account_id = a.id
  JOIN sales_reps s
  ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
  GROUP BY s.name, channel
  ORDER BY COUNT DESC;
```

4. Determine the number of times a particular channel was used in the web_events table for each region. Your final table should have three columns - the region name, the channel, and the number of occurrences. Order your table with the highest number of occurrences first.
```
  SELECT	r.name,
  		    w.channel,
          COUNT(w.channel)
  FROM web_events w
  JOIN accounts a
  ON w.account_id = a.id
  JOIN sales_reps s
  ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
  JOIN region r
  ON s.region_id = r.id
  GROUP BY r.name, w.channel
  ORDER BY count DESC;
```

### [DISTINCT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDJEHkgKORY)   
<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YDJEHkgKORY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

**DISTINCT** is always used in **SELECT** statements, and it provides the unique rows for all columns written in the SELECT statement. Therefore, you only use DISTINCT once in any particular SELECT statement.

You could write:

```
  SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, column3
  FROM table1;
```
which would return the unique (or DISTINCT) rows across all three columns.

You would not write:
```
  SELECT DISTINCT column1, DISTINCT column2, DISTINCT column3
  FROM table1;
```
You can think of DISTINCT the same way you might think of the statement "unique".

**DISTINCT - Expert Tip**

It’s worth noting that using DISTINCT, particularly in aggregations, can slow your queries down quite a bit.

#### Exercises:

1. Use DISTINCT to test if there are any accounts associated with more than one region.
>The below two queries have the same number of resulting rows (351), so we know that every account is associated with only one region. If each account was associated with more than one region, the first query should have returned more rows than the second query.

```
  SELECT a.id as "account id", r.id as "region id",
  a.name as "account name", r.name as "region name"
  FROM accounts a
  JOIN sales_reps s
  ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
  JOIN region r
  ON r.id = s.region_id;
```
>and

```
  SELECT DISTINCT id, name
  FROM accounts;
```
2. Have any sales reps worked on more than one account?

>Actually all of the sales reps have worked on more than one account. The fewest number of accounts any sales rep works on is 3. There are 50 sales reps, and they all have more than one account. Using DISTINCT in the second query assures that all of the sales reps are accounted for in the first query.

```
  SELECT s.id, s.name, COUNT(*) num_accounts
  FROM accounts a
  JOIN sales_reps s
  ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
  GROUP BY s.id, s.name
  ORDER BY num_accounts;
```
>and

```
  SELECT DISTINCT id, name
  FROM sales_reps;
```

### [HAVING](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4gmN0vnk58)
<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D4gmN0vnk58" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>  

**HAVING - Expert Tip**

HAVING is the “clean” way to filter a query that has been aggregated, but this is also commonly done using a [subquery](https://community.modeanalytics.com/sql/tutorial/sql-subqueries/). Essentially, any time you want to perform a WHERE on an element of your query that was created by an aggregate, you need to use **HAVING** instead.

* WHERE subsets the returned data based on a logical condition.

* WHERE appears after the FROM, JOIN, and ON clauses, but before GROUP BY.

* HAVING appears after the GROUP BY clause, but before the ORDER BY clause.

* HAVING is like WHERE, but it works on logical statements involving aggregations.

#### Exercises:

1. How many of the sales reps have more than 5 accounts that they manage?

```
  SELECT s.name rep, COUNT(a.name) account
  FROM accounts a
  JOIN sales_reps s
  ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
  GROUP BY s.name
  HAVING COUNT(a.name) > 5
  ORDER BY account;
```

`34`

>and technically, we can get this using a SUBQUERY as shown below. This same logic can be used for the other queries, but this will not be shown.

```
  SELECT COUNT(*) num_reps_above5
  FROM(SELECT s.id, s.name, COUNT(*) num_accounts
       FROM accounts a
       JOIN sales_reps s
       ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
       GROUP BY s.id, s.name
       HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
       ORDER BY num_accounts) AS Table1;
```

2. How many accounts have more than 20 orders?
```
  SELECT a.name account, COUNT(o.*) orders
  FROM accounts a
  JOIN orders o
  ON a.id = o.account_id
  GROUP BY 1
  HAVING COUNT(o.*) > 20
  ORDER BY orders;
```

`120`

3. Which account has the most orders?
```
  SELECT a.name account, COUNT(o.*) orders
  FROM accounts a
  JOIN orders o
  ON a.id = o.account_id
  GROUP BY 1
  ORDER BY orders DESC
  LIMIT 1;
```

4. Which accounts spent more than 30,000 usd total across all orders?
```
SELECT	a.name account,
		    SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total
FROM accounts a
JOIN orders o
ON a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY 1
HAVING SUM(o.total_amt_usd) > 30000
ORDER BY account
```
5. Which accounts spent less than 1,000 usd total across all orders?
```
  SELECT	a.name account,
  		    SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total
  FROM accounts a
  JOIN orders o
  ON a.id = o.account_id
  GROUP BY 1
  HAVING SUM(o.total_amt_usd) < 1000
  ORDER BY account
```

6. Which account has spent the most with us?
```
  SELECT	a.name account,
  		    SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total
  FROM accounts a
  JOIN orders o
  ON a.id = o.account_id
  GROUP BY 1
  ORDER BY total DESC
  LIMIT 1;
```
`EOG Resources	382873.30`

7. Which account has spent the least with us?
```
  SELECT	a.name account,
  		    SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total
  FROM accounts a
  JOIN orders o
  ON a.id = o.account_id
  GROUP BY 1
  ORDER BY total
  LIMIT 1;
```

8. Which accounts used facebook as a channel to contact customers more than 6 times?
```
SELECT  a.name,
        COUNT(channel = 'facebook')
FROM web_events w
JOIN accounts a
ON w.account_id = a.id
GROUP BY 1
HAVING COUNT(channel = 'facebook') > 6
ORDER BY 2
```
>OR

```
  SELECT a.id, a.name, w.channel, COUNT(*) use_of_channel
  FROM accounts a
  JOIN web_events w
  ON a.id = w.account_id
  GROUP BY a.id, a.name, w.channel
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 6 AND w.channel = 'facebook'
  ORDER BY use_of_channel;
```

9. Which account used facebook most as a channel?
```
  SELECT a.name, COUNT(w.channel)
  FROM web_events w
  JOIN accounts a
  ON w.account_id = a.id
  WHERE w.channel = 'facebook'
  GROUP BY 1
  ORDER BY 2 DESC
```

`Gilead Sciences	16`

>OR

```
  SELECT a.id, a.name, w.channel, COUNT(*) use_of_channel
  FROM accounts a
  JOIN web_events w
  ON a.id = w.account_id
  WHERE w.channel = 'facebook'
  GROUP BY a.id, a.name, w.channel
  ORDER BY use_of_channel DESC
  LIMIT 1;
```

>Note: This query above only works if there are no ties for the account that used facebook the most. It is a best practice to use a larger limit number first such as 3 or 5 to see if there are ties before using LIMIT 1.

10. Which channel was most frequently used by most accounts?

```
  SELECT	DISTINCT w.channel,
  		count(a.name)
  FROM web_events w
  JOIN accounts a
  ON w.account_id = a.id
  GROUP BY w.channel
  ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

>OR

```
  SELECT a.id, a.name, w.channel, COUNT(*) use_of_channel
  FROM accounts a
  JOIN web_events w
  ON a.id = w.account_id
  GROUP BY a.id, a.name, w.channel
  ORDER BY use_of_channel DESC
  LIMIT 10;

### [DATE Functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Z6GMFVmIY
  <iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E7Z6GMFVmIY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>   

**GROUP**ing **BY** a date column is not usually very useful in SQL, as these columns tend to have transaction data down to a second. Keeping date information at such a granular data is both a blessing and a curse, as it gives really precise information (a blessing), but it makes grouping information together directly difficult (a curse).

Lucky for us, there are a number of built in SQL functions that are aimed at helping us improve our experience in working with dates.

**Here we saw that dates are stored in year, month, day, hour, minute, second, which helps us in truncating. In the next concept, you will see a number of functions we can use in SQL to take advantage of this functionality**.

In [this link you can find the formatting of dates around the world, as referenced in the video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_format_by_country).

### [DATE Functions II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPWkDhW4cLI)
<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UPWkDhW4cLI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>  

The first function you are introduced to in working with dates is **DATE_TRUNC**.

**DATE_TRUNC** allows you to truncate your date to a particular part of your date-time column. Common trunctions are **day**, **month**, and **year**. [Here](https://blog.modeanalytics.com/date-trunc-sql-timestamp-function-count-on/) is a great blog post by Mode Analytics on the power of this function.

**DATE_PART** can be useful for pulling a specific portion of a date, but notice pulling month or day of the week (dow) means that you are no longer keeping the years in order. Rather you are grouping for certain components regardless of which year they belonged in.

For additional functions you can use with dates, check out the documentation [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/functions-datetime.html), but the **DATE_TRUNC** and **DATE_PART** functions definitely give you a great start!

You can reference the columns in your select statement in **GROUP BY** and **ORDER BY** clauses with numbers that follow the order they appear in the select statement. For example
```
  SELECT standard_qty, COUNT(\*)
  FROM orders
  GROUP BY 1 (this 1 refers to standard_qty since it is the first of the columns included in the select statement)
  ORDER BY 1 (this 1 refers to standard_qty since it is the first of the columns included in the select statement)
```
#### Exercises:

1. Find the sales in terms of total dollars for all orders in each year, ordered from greatest to least. Do you notice any trends in the yearly sales totals?

My Answer

```
  SELECT	DATE_TRUNC('year', occurred_at) AS year,
  		  SUM(total_amt_usd) AS total_usd
  FROM 	orders
  GROUP BY 1
  ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
>Revenue is up especially in 2014 and 2016, did they have better sales and marketing strategies those years? better promotions or better customer satisfaction?, but overall the average orders per year have gone up! 108 in 2014, 143 in 2015 and 313 in 2016.

Udacity's Answer

```
  SELECT DATE_PART('year', occurred_at) ord_year,  SUM(total_amt_usd) total_spent
  FROM orders
  GROUP BY 1
  ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
>When we look at the yearly totals, you might notice that 2013 and 2017 have much smaller totals than all other years. If we look further at the monthly data, we see that for 2013 and 2017 there is only one month of sales for each of these years (12 for 2013 and 1 for 2017). Therefore, neither of these are evenly represented. Sales have been increasing year over year, with 2016 being the largest sales to date. At this rate, we might expect 2017 to have the largest sales.

2. Which month did Parch & Posey have the greatest sales in terms of total dollars? Are all months evenly represented by the dataset?

My Answer

```
  SELECT DATE_PART('month', occurred_at) AS month, SUM(total_amt_usd) AS total_sales_by_month
  FROM orders
  GROUP BY 1
  ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

>December, October and November are always good for business, January, February and March saw a slow down in sales. And No, the months are not evenly represented in 2013 and 2017.

Udacity's Answer


>In order for this to be 'fair', we should remove the sales from 2013 and 2017. For the same reasons as discussed above.

```
  SELECT DATE_PART('month', occurred_at) ord_month, SUM(total_amt_usd) total_spent
  FROM orders
  WHERE occurred_at BETWEEN '2014-01-01' AND '2017-01-01'
  GROUP BY 1
  ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
>The greatest sales amounts occur in December (12).


3. Which year did Parch & Posey have the greatest sales in terms of total number of orders? Are all years evenly represented by the dataset?

My Answer

```
  SELECT  DATE_TRUNC('year', occurred_at) AS year, SUM(total_amt_usd) as total_usd
  FROM orders
  GROUP BY 1
  ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
>2016 sets the record for the most revenue. 2013 and 2017 doesnt have enough months in their record to accurately compare it to the rest of the dataset.

Udacity's Answer

```
  SELECT DATE_PART('year', occurred_at) ord_year,  COUNT(*) total_sales
  FROM orders
  GROUP BY 1
  ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
>Again, 2016 by far has the most amount of orders, but again 2013 and 2017 are not evenly represented to the other years in the dataset.

4. Which month did Parch & Posey have the greatest sales in terms of total number of orders? Are all months evenly represented by the dataset?

My Answer

```
  SELECT DATE_PART('month', occurred_at) AS month, SUM(total_amt_usd) AS total_sales_by_month
  FROM orders
  GROUP BY 1
  ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

>December, October and November are always good for business, January, February and March saw a slow down in sales. And yes, the months are evenly represented EXCEPT 2013 and 2017.

Udacity's Answer

```
  SELECT DATE_PART('month', occurred_at) ord_month, COUNT(*) total_sales
  FROM orders
  WHERE occurred_at BETWEEN '2014-01-01' AND '2017-01-01'
  GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
>December still has the most sales, but interestingly, November has the second most sales (but not the most dollar sales. To make a fair comparison from one month to another 2017 and 2013 data were removed.

5. In which month of which year did Walmart spend the most on gloss paper in terms of dollars?

My Answer

```
  SELECT  DATE_TRUNC('month',o.occurred_at) order_date,
          a.name,
          SUM(o.gloss_amt_usd)
  FROM accounts a
  JOIN orders o
  ON a.id = o.account_id
  WHERE name = 'Walmart'
  GROUP BY 1,2
  ORDER BY 3 DESC
  LIMIT 5
```

`May 2016 Walmart	spent the most on gloss paper with total cost of $9257.64.`

Udacity's Answer

`Same as mine`

### [CASE Statements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BInXuTY_FzE)
<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BInXuTY_FzE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>  

**CASE - Expert Tip**

* The CASE statement always goes in the SELECT clause.

* CASE must include the following components: WHEN, THEN, and END. ELSE is an optional component to catch cases that didn’t meet any of the other previous CASE conditions.

* You can make any conditional statement using any conditional operator (like WHERE) between WHEN and THEN. This includes stringing together multiple conditional statements using AND and OR.

You can include multiple WHEN statements, as well as an ELSE statement again, to deal with any unaddressed conditions.

**Example**

In a quiz question in the previous Basic SQL lesson, you saw this question:

Create a column that divides the standard_amt_usd by the standard_qty to find the unit price for standard paper for each order. Limit the results to the first 10 orders, and include the id and account_id fields. **NOTE - you will be thrown an error with the correct solution to this question. This is for a division by zero. You will learn how to get a solution without an error to this query when you learn about CASE statements in a later section**.

Let's see how we can use the **CASE** statement to get around this error.
```
  SELECT id, account_id, standard_amt_usd/standard_qty AS unit_price
  FROM orders
  LIMIT 10;
```
Now, let's use a **CASE** statement. This way any time the standard_qty is zero, we will return 0, and otherwise we will return the unit_price.
```
SELECT account_id, CASE WHEN standard_qty = 0 OR standard_qty IS NULL THEN 0
                    ELSE standard_amt_usd/standard_qty END AS unit_price
FROM orders
LIMIT 10;
```
Now the first part of the statement will catch any of those division by zero values that were causing the error, and the other components will compute the division as necessary. You will notice, we essentially charge all of our accounts 4.99 for standard paper. It makes sense this doesn't fluctuate, and it is more accurate than adding 1 in the denominator like our quick fix might have been in the earlier lesson.

### [CASE & Aggregations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asSXB6iD3z4)
<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/asSXB6iD3z4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>  

This one is pretty tricky. Try running the query yourself to make sure you understand what is happening. The next concept will give you some practice writing **CASE** statements on your own. In this video, we showed that getting the same information using a **WHERE** clause means only being able to get one set of data from the **CASE** at a time.

There are some advantages to separating data into separate columns like this depending on what you want to do, but often this level of separation might be easier to do in another programming language - rather than with SQL.

#### Exercises:

1. Write a query to display for each order, the account ID, total amount of the order, and the level of the order - ‘Large’ or ’Small’ - depending on if the order is $3000 or more, or smaller than $3000.

My Answer

```
	SELECT 	account_id, total_amt_usd,
		CASE WHEN total_amt_usd >= 3000 THEN 'Large'
		     WHEN total_amt_usd < 3000 THEN 'Small'
		     END AS order_level
	FROM orders
```
Udacity's

```
	SELECT account_id, total_amt_usd,
	CASE WHEN total_amt_usd > 3000 THEN 'Large'
	ELSE 'Small' END AS order_level
	FROM orders;
```
2. Write a query to display the number of orders in each of three categories, based on the total number of items in each order. The three categories are: 'At Least 2000', 'Between 1000 and 2000' and 'Less than 1000'.

My Answer

```
	SELECT	standard_qty,
		CASE	WHEN standard_qty > 2000 THEN 'At Least 2000'
			WHEN standard_qty <= 2000 AND standard_qty >= 1000 THEN 'Between 1000 and 2000'
			WHEN standard_qty < 1000 THEN 'Less than 1000'
			END AS category
	FROM orders
	GROUP BY 1
	ORDER BY 1 DESC
```
`Then substitute poster and gloss instead of standard.`

>My answer is wrong! I mis-understood the question!!!

Udacity's
```
	SELECT CASE WHEN total >= 2000 THEN 'At Least 2000'
	   	    WHEN total >= 1000 AND total < 2000 THEN 'Between 1000 and 2000'
	   	    ELSE 'Less than 1000' END AS order_category,
	       COUNT(*) AS order_count
	FROM orders
	GROUP BY 1;
```

3. We would like to understand 3 different levels of customers based on the amount associated with their purchases. The top level includes anyone with a Lifetime Value (total sales of all orders) greater than 200,000 usd. The second level is between 200,000 and 100,000 usd. The lowest level is anyone under 100,000 usd. Provide a table that includes the level associated with each account. You should provide the account name, the total sales of all orders for the customer, and the level. Order with the top spending customers listed first.

My Answer

```
	SELECT	SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_usd, a.name account,
			CASE WHEN SUM(o.total_amt_usd) > 200000 THEN 'Above 200K'
			     WHEN SUM(o.total_amt_usd) <= 200000 AND SUM(o.total_amt_usd) >= 100000  THEN 'Between 200K to 100K'
			     WHEN SUM(o.total_amt_usd) < 100000 THEN 'Below 100K'
			     END AS LTV
	FROM orders o
	JOIN accounts a
	ON a.id = o.account_id
	GROUP BY 2
	ORDER BY 1 DESC
```
Udacity's

```
	SELECT	a.name, SUM(total_amt_usd) total_spent,
	     	CASE WHEN SUM(total_amt_usd) > 200000 THEN 'top'
	     	     WHEN  SUM(total_amt_usd) > 100000 THEN 'middle'
	     	     ELSE 'low' END AS customer_level
	FROM orders o
	JOIN accounts a
	ON o.account_id = a.id
	GROUP BY a.name
	ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

4. We would now like to perform a similar calculation to the first, but we want to obtain the total amount spent by customers only in 2016 and 2017. Keep the same levels as in the previous question. Order with the top spending customers listed first.

My Answer

```
SELECT	DATE_PART('year', o.occurred_at) ord_year,
	a.name account,
	SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_usd,
	CASE 	WHEN SUM(o.total_amt_usd) > 200000 THEN 'Above 200K'
		WHEN SUM(o.total_amt_usd) <= 200000 AND SUM(o.total_amt_usd) >= 100000  THEN 'Between 200K to 100K'
		WHEN SUM(o.total_amt_usd) < 100000 THEN 'Below 100K'
		END AS LTV
	FROM orders o
	JOIN accounts a
	ON a.id = o.account_id
  	WHERE DATE_PART('year', o.occurred_at) = '2016' OR DATE_PART('year', o.occurred_at) = '2017'
	GROUP BY 1,2
	ORDER BY 3 DESC

```
Udacity's

```
	SELECT a.name, SUM(total_amt_usd) total_spent,
	     CASE WHEN SUM(total_amt_usd) > 200000 THEN 'top'
	     WHEN  SUM(total_amt_usd) > 100000 THEN 'middle'
	     ELSE 'low' END AS customer_level
	FROM orders o
	JOIN accounts a
	ON o.account_id = a.id
	WHERE occurred_at > '2015-12-31'
	GROUP BY 1
	ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

5. We would like to identify top performing sales reps, which are sales reps associated with more than 200 orders. Create a table with the sales rep name, the total number of orders, and a column with top or not depending on if they have more than 200 orders. Place the top sales people first in your final table.

My Answer

```
	SELECT	s.name rep, COUNT(o.*),
		CASE WHEN COUNT(o.*) > 200 THEN 'TOP in SALES!!!'
		     ELSE 'NOT' END AS performance
	FROM sales_reps s
	JOIN accounts a
	ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
	JOIN orders o
	ON a.id = o.account_id
	GROUP BY 1
	ORDER BY 2 DESC
```
Udacity's

```
	SELECT 	s.name, COUNT(*) num_ords,
	     	CASE WHEN COUNT(*) > 200 THEN 'top'
	     	ELSE 'not' END AS sales_rep_level
	FROM orders o
	JOIN accounts a
	ON o.account_id = a.id
	JOIN sales_reps s
	ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
	GROUP BY s.name
	ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
>It is worth mentioning that this assumes each name is unique - which has been done a few times. We otherwise would want to break by the name and the id of the table.

6. The previous didn't account for the middle, nor the dollar amount associated with the sales. Management decides they want to see these characteristics represented as well. We would like to identify top performing sales reps, which are sales reps associated with more than 200 orders or more than 750000 in total sales. The middle group has any rep with more than 150 orders or 500000 in sales. Create a table with the sales rep name, the total number of orders, total sales across all orders, and a column with top, middle, or low depending on this criteria. Place the top sales people based on dollar amount of sales first in your final table. You might see a few upset sales people by this criteria!

My Answer

```
	SELECT	s.name rep,
		SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_sales,
		COUNT(o.*),
		CASE WHEN COUNT(o.*) > 200 OR SUM(o.total_amt_usd) > 750000 THEN 'TOP!!!'
		     WHEN COUNT(o.*) > 150 OR SUM(o.total_amt_usd) > 500000 THEN 'MIDDLE!!!'
		     ELSE 'LOW' END AS performance
	FROM sales_reps s
	JOIN accounts a
	ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
	JOIN orders o
	ON a.id = o.account_id
	GROUP BY 1
	ORDER BY 2 DESC

```
Udacity's

```
	SELECT	s.name, COUNT(*),
		SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_spent,
	     	CASE WHEN COUNT(*) > 200 OR SUM(o.total_amt_usd) > 750000 THEN 'top'
	     	     WHEN COUNT(*) > 150 OR SUM(o.total_amt_usd) > 500000 THEN 'middle'
	             ELSE 'low' END AS sales_rep_level
	FROM orders o
	JOIN accounts a
	ON o.account_id = a.id
	JOIN sales_reps s
	ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
	GROUP BY s.name
	ORDER BY 3 DESC;
```

### RECAP

Each of the sections has been labeled to assist if you need to revisit a particular topic. Intentionally, the solutions for a particular section are actually not in the labeled section, because my hope is this will force you to practice if you have a question about a particular topic we covered.

You have now gained a ton of useful skills associated with SQL. The combination of **JOINs** and **Aggregations** are one of the reasons SQL is such a powerful tool.

If there was a particular topic you struggled with, I suggest coming back and revisiting the questions with a fresh mind. The more you practice the better, but you also don't want to get stuck on the same problem for an extended period of time!
